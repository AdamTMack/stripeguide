# Session History (Compacted)

## Session 1 — Initial Implementation
Built the entire app in one session: scene engine with 25 lazy-loaded scenes across 5 acts, guide avatar system with typewriter dialog, branching navigation, tech overlay system (Code/Flow/Webhooks), and all educational content. Phases 1, 2, and 4 fully complete; Phase 3 (live Stripe demos) partially done — demo components coded but not wired into scenes, no backend API. Production build: 448KB/143KB gzipped, 57 source files, 0 TypeScript errors.

## Session 2 — Phase 3: Live Stripe Demos
Completed Phase 3: Express backend (`server/index.js`) handling hosted/embedded/payment-intent modes, Vite dev proxy, all three demo components wired into Act 3 scenes, TestPaymentScene using live PaymentElementDemo. Created wrapup procedure and session docs infrastructure.
